# IES R Tutorial GitHub Page

The goal of this project is to provide a brief introduction to the free and powerful [R Programming Language](https://www.r-project.org/) for IES Pre-Doctoral Fellows. 

Step one is to download and install both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/); RStudio is at core a popular and robust IDE for R, but for the purposes of this tutorial you're fine to just consider R and RStudio to be one and the same thing. 

This tutorial is designed to be concise and oriented towards doing typical things in education research. There is a litany of other resources available for learning R from other perspectives; see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/info) page for an extensive list.
